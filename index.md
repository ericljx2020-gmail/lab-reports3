# Lab Report 3(Week 5)

## `grep -v`(Source: *Chatgpt*)
`grep` was used to check if a specific string is in the target file or not. If it is in the file, it will output the specific line it is located. 
**However when you add a -v to the end, it will output all the lines that does not contain the string given.**

*Examples*
## 1. Use grep -v to find all the file that doesn't contain "China" in the file name

```
find written_2/ -name "*China*.txt" > find_CN.txt                  --Used to find all the txt files that has China in the name and write it into a file

find written_2/ -name "*.txt" > alltx.txt                          --Used to find all the txt files in the written_2 directory and write it into a file

grep -v "China" alltx.txt > noCN.txt                               --Used to find files that doesn't have China in itusing grep -v.

grep "China" noCN.txt                                              --Trying to find China in noCN.txtm and there is no "China"
output: N/A

grep "China" alltx.txt                                             --Proving that there are txt files in the directory that contain China in the file name.
output:
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-History.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhatToDo.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt
```

## 2. Use grep -v to find lines in *Bahamas-History* that doesn't contain "Lucayans"
```
grep -v "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt > noLucas.txt.        --noLucas is a file contains all the line of Bahamas-History.txt, except for those containing Lucayans

grep "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt                          --this is a proof that Bahamas-History.txt contains Lucayans
output:
Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

grep "Lucayans" noLucas.txt                                                                   --Trying to find Lucayans in this file generated by grep -v
output: N/A
```

## `grep -n`(Source: *Chatgpt*)
This option adds line numbers to the output, which can be useful for tracking down a specific line of text.

*Examples*
## 1. use grep -n to get the line index of government's appearance in Bahamas-History.txt.
```
grep -n "government" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt                     --This has the same effect as grep but with line number
output:
12:Most ... the latter officially authorized by their governments...
30:Prohibition brought gloom to millions of American Bahamas government...
37:Under a new constitution in 1964, the colony was given self-government...
38:Since independence the Bahamas has kept British systems of judiciary and government yet has moved closer economically to its near neighbor, the US. The Bahamian Government...
```

## 2. use grep -n to get the line index of government's appearance in Bahamas-History.txt.
```
grep -n "colony" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt
output:
10:In 1648 a group of English Puritans from Bermuda, led by William Sayle, sailed to Bahamian waters and established the first permanent European settlement on the island they named Eleutheria (now Eleuthera) after the Greek word for freedom. The 70 colonists called themselves the Eleutherian Adventurers, but life was very difficult and the colony never flourished, though Sayle was long honored for the effort. In 1666 a smaller island (called Sayle’s island) with a fine harbor was settled by Bermudians and renamed New Providence. It was later to become known as Nassau, capital of the Bahamas.
13:In 1718, shortly after the Bahamas became a crown colony, Captain Woodes Rogers, a renowned ex-privateer, was named the first royal governor. Arriving in Nassau with a powerful force and promising amnesty for surrender, he became a legend by cleaning out many of the pirates and establishing some order. This incident inspired the national motto Expulsis Piratis — Restituta Commercia (Pirates Expelled — Commerce Restored), which was retained until 1971.
24:Slavery in the Bahamas was not as widespread or as vicious as on many sugar islands in the Caribbean. Some slaves were voluntarily freed or sold their liberty by loyalist owners. After 1804, no slaves were imported into the Bahamas. By 1822, the first registration counted 10,808 slaves on the 17 inhabited islands or island clusters. After Parliament in London abolished slavery in 1833, there was a transitional apprenticeship period of 5 years before all slaves in the colony became fully free on 1 August 1838. This included a few thousand slaves from ships captured by the Royal Navy. They were housed in specially founded settlements on New Providence and the Out Islands.
33:In some respects, World War II put the Bahamas on the international map. The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “destroyers for bases” deal in 1940. Allied forces operated submarine-hunting and air-sea rescue stations on the islands; Royal Air Force pilots and Royal Navy frogmen were trained here, and much trans-Atlantic air traffic passed through the Bahamas.
34:Then, to the astonishment of the local populace, the Duke of Windsor, having given up his throne for an American divorcée, was named governor of the little colony in 1940. He and the Duchess remained until 1945.
37:Under a new constitution in 1964, the colony was given self-government with a ministerial-parliamentary system. In 1967 elections, the Progressive Liberal Party was victorious, its leader Lynden O. Pindling becoming premier. Following a constitutional conference in London, the Bahamas became fully independent on July 10, 1973, and is now a member of the United Nations and the British Commonwealth. In August 1992 the Progressive Liberal Party, still headed by Lynden O. Pindling, was toppled by the Free National Movement after 25 years in power. Today’s prime minister is Hubert Ingraham.

## `grep -rl`
grep -rl returns the names of the files that contain matches, rather than the matching lines themselves. It search all the subdirectories recursively until it get all the files that contains the specific String.

# Examples
## 1. grep -rl to get files that contains "government" in data directory
```
grep -rl "government" written_2/

# grep -c
grep -c only return the number of lines in the file that contain the String passed.

## Examples
## 1. grep -c to find how many lines in Bahamas-History.txt contain government
```
####The following two lines are used to write lines in Bahamas-History.txt that contain government in count.txt and we use wc to count the line of if.
####By doing this, we wiill know how many lines are there that contains government in Bahamas-History.txt, and we can justify the answer we get later.
grep "government" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt > count.txt  
wc count.txt   

grep -c "government" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt
output:
4

####This shows that grep -c correctly show the number of lines in Bahamas-History that contain "government"
```

## 2. grep -c to find how many lines in Bahamas-History.txt contain Lucayans
```
grep -c "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt
output:
2
####Therefore, 2 is the number of lines that contains lucayans in Bahamas0History.
```

**All of these four command options are interesting to use and especially useful. I am getting used to running them after doing all these excercise.**
